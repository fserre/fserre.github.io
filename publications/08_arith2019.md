abstract: |
            We present a hardware generator for signal processing algorithms that consist of a network of small processing elements, including the fast Fourier transform and sorting networks. The generator is implemented in Scala and uses a principled design that leverages modern language features to generate an entire design space of hardware implementations. Examples include the use of embedded domain-specific languages and staging to represent and optimize the designs at different levels of abstraction, and the use of Scala's type system to efficiently encode different degrees of hardware reuse and arithmetic formats.
