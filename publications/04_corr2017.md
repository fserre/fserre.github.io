            We propose a way of characterizing the algorithms computing a Walsh-Hadamard transform that consist of a sequence of arrays of butterflies ($\I_{2^{n-1}} \otimes \text{DFT}_2$) interleaved by linear permutations. Linear permutations are those that map linearly the binary representation of its element indices. We also propose a method to enumerate these algorithms.
