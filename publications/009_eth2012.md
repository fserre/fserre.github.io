            Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (MMM) is a key computational kernel in scientific and engineering applications. Therefore, different implementations of this operation have been designed for FPGAs. However, it is hard to find, given a particular set of constraints (maximal number of slices, minimum frequency), the most appropriate design. This thesis proposes the Operator Language for Schedules (OLS) to describe hardware designs that can perform MMM on arbitrarily-sized matrices. Algorithmic and implementation strategies such as blocking and reuse are represented as a set of rewriting rules that are recursively applied to OLS expressions. Finally, a compiler was built to translate a final OLS expression into Verilog code. The different rewriting-rules that can be recursively applied, given the size requirements for MMM, give rise to large design space. Every design alternative, for a subset of matrix sizes, was synthesized and routed for our target FPGA platform and precise cost and performance metrics were stored in a database. Designers can later visualize the alternatives in our database and choose the design that suits the goals and constraints of the target system.
