            Many algorithms used in hardware applications across disciplines, such as the fast Fourier transform, the Walsh-Hadamard transform or sorting networks share a common structure. They consist of stages of parallel and identical processing elements that each operates on two inputs with different data permutations in between. The symmetry in this structure enables folding to an area-efficient in a streaming architecture that accepts the input over several cycles. However, necessary for folding are streaming permutation circuits that require memory and routing components. In this dissertation, we focus on the optimal implementation of these algorithms. We provide lower bounds for the implementation of streaming permutations, and propose algorithms that produce solutions that match it (under certain assumptions). We apply these algorithms in the context of a generator capable of implementing the hardware applications previously mentioned. Finally, for a given problem, we address the question of finding an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm which streaming implementations are the cheapest to implement.
