            The Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) is computed using a network of butterflies, similar to the fast Fourier transform. The network is not unique but can be modified in exponentially many ways by properly changing the permutations between butterfly stages. Our first contribution is the exact char-acterization of all possible WHT networks. Then we aim to find the optimal networks for streaming implementations. In such an implementation the input is fed in chunks over several cycles and the hardware cost is thus reduced in proportion. To find the optimal network we smartly search through all possibilities for small sizes and discover novel networks that are thus proven optimal. The results can be used to extrapolate the optimal hardware cost for all sizes but the associated algorithms still remain elusive.
