            We present a generator for fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on hardware. The input of the generator is a high-level description of an FFT algorithm; the output is a token-based, synchronized design in the form of RTL-Verilog. Building on prior work, the generator uses several layers of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to represent and optimize at different levels of abstraction to produce a RAM-and area-efficient hardware implementation. Two of these layers and DSLs are novel. The first one allows the use and domain-specific optimization of state-of-the-art streaming permutations. The second DSL enables the automatic pipelining of a streaming hardware dataflow and the synchronization of its data-independent control signals. The generator including the DSLs are implemented in Scala, leveraging its type system, and uses concepts from lightweight modular staging (LMS) to handle the constraints of streaming hardware. Particularly, these concepts offer genericity over hardware number representation, including seamlessly switching between fixed-point arithmetic and FloPoCo generated IEEE floating-point operators, while ensuring type-safety. We show benchmarks of generated FFTs that outperform prior FFT generators.
